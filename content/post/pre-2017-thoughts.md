### A Collection of 0's
In the last 5 years, I have not stopped pursuing startup ideas since coming across the term in university for the very first time.

Although my investment of time in startups has not provided me with a monetary return, it has however provided me with new experiences, knowledge and skills that can't be attained from working within the corporate world.

I like to think of it as adding a “0” to my value every time I pick up something new, and that I have built up a solid number of value adding 0, 000, 000’s across the years.

One day, I’ll be able to add a "1" in front of all those 0’s I've collected, and capitalise my investment. Yes, I am banking on $10,000,000... A girl can dream! 💁

### Adding That 1
Having spent the last 3 years working in corporate figuring life out, saving money and a total of 6 years finding and fine-tuning myself. It’s now time to stop faffing about and start consolidating everything I’ve learnt and experienced into turning an idea into a successful product/service.

Let 2017 be a year of getting shit done!
