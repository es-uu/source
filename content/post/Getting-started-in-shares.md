### Clean Slate
I have 7 soldiers (stock) that are currently out fighting for me in the land of the ASX whom are severely injured, bleeding and suffering from profound malnutrition. All their health have dropped at least 30% and for sometime now, I have turned a blind eye and left them all there to fend for themselves.

To be fair, I'm not a great "stock general" because I never researched or strategised my plan of attack. I simply went where the wind blew, that wind being my friends and of course, if they had knew better, then they all would have been filthy rich a long time ago by now.

I don't blame them though because I can be quite trusting and also a big gambler. It's the risk I chose to take and I embrace the loss without being a sore loser. The real reason for writing this post is to actually give the share market another go, but this time of course based on my own analysis and predictions.

**Currently reading:** Stock Investing & Trading (Illustrated edition). I'm hoping the somewhat colourful photos will keep my eyes from glazing over.
