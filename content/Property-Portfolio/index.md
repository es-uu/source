### The Strategy
My property investment strategy here in Melbourne, Australia is simple and that is to invest in houses with land only. It's the one thing the world has stopped making a long time ago, anything else and you're helping the banks and property developers make money.

### My First House
In 2015, I was a 23 year old Consultant travelling in-between states for work and witnessed that the property market was booming. Knowing full well that inflation erodes the real value of money, and that our salary is not keeping up with the growth of properties, I was adamant on purchasing my first house.

Already on a shoestring budget and literally living off frozen meals from Coles, I managed to save up $77,577. I was still a shy 10% away from having enough money for a 20% deposit in my ideal suburb, but luckily my parents had sold the family home in 2014 which gave me the opportunity to invest their money making $160,000 after tax.

After much research and with my fingers and toes crossed, I purchased a 3 bedroom home in Vermont for $701,900.

### My Second House
In November, my house in Vermont had built up $100,000 in equity and I also saved up another $30,000. It's normally not advised to invest with family or friends, but I did it anyway and purchased a joint property in Heathmont for $720,000.
