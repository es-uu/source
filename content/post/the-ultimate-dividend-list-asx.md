### The Dividend Route
I'm going to build a diversified portfolio of dividend yielding shares starting clean slate with the simple strategy of buying in a good month in advance from the ex dividend date and selling after the price recovers after the date payable. I'll also compile a spreadsheet to analyse which shares to buy, hold and sell using simple calculations like:

**Dividend Yield Ratio**
The annual dividends per share / current share Price

**Franked Dividends**
Adjusting dividends per share based on whether the company has already paid tax prior to distribution.

**Caveat Emptor**
Finding out the reason why the company is paying a high dividend. This could be due to a falling share price, poor future prospects and/or a once-off dividend payment.

**Sector Bias**
Resource companies
