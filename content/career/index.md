# My Career History.
<br>
### Pre-Corporate

I have always been a dreamer about what I could achieve with technology. It‚Äôs fair to say I have an entrepreneurial spirit where my mind is always curious and bubbling with new ideas. I naturally traversed between the intersections of business and technology during university, and believed that one day I was going to build my own startup.

### 2014
Well‚Ä¶ 90% (or more) of startups fail and I was not ready to give up my pay check week after week to learn the important life lessons from failure. So I did the next best thing and joined a global technology and innovation consultancy company.

However, a year into the life of a consultant who was barely considered technical, I found myself on the opposite side of the innovation spectrum and worse, I was pigeonholed in mundane roles nobody wanted. The lesson I learnt in consulting was that you had to drive your own career and get good at something fast.

Basically, I woke up one day and realised I was living on autopilot. I was going to work each day because I had to, and not because I wanted to. I reached a point in life where the feeling of not having to go to work the next day was worth a million dollars, and that was not the way to live my early 20s.

### 2015
The future of my career looked bleak and it was time I took full control of my own life and directed it to where I wanted it to be. I decided I was going to learn how to code to get closer to achieving my startup dream.

**March** -- I started learning Swift 1.2 from an online course in the lobby of my hotel each night after work.

**May** -- Participated in a hackathon as a developer to see how far I could get with what I‚Äôve learnt from the course, which at the time was still incomplete. I was inspired by amazing developers, made new friends with a lot of like-minded people and even found myself somehow in second place!

**July** --‚ÄäBy the end of the course, I had developed a collection of small applications. The code was rather ‚Äúhacked‚Äù together and didn‚Äôt follow the typical MVC model, but nevertheless it had helped build up my confidence in app development.

**September** -- Swift 2 was released and I started exploring more intermediate courses and tutorials on topics like object-orientated programming, cocoapods, core data, databases, auto layout, concurrency, Git and different design patterns.

### 2016
**January** -- Released my first app onto the app store. An app that helps discover scenic places for those Sunday afternoon drives you‚Äôd love, but probably just don‚Äôt know about.

**February** -- Applied for 3 mobile development positions.

**May** -- Was rejected by 2 and finally heard back from the 3rd company for an interview, and on the 29th of May 2016, was offered the position of Mobile Engineer üéâ.

**July** -- Started my new job (current).
