### Goodbye Car 🚗
This year I made the decision to say goodbye  to my beloved Audi of 4 years and rely purely on public transport to get around. Sure owning a car makes me feel really good and everything a lot more convenient too, but the thing is, so is public transport, which demotes owning a car to only a nice to have thing.

There simply just isn’t a good enough reason for keeping the car anymore. It’s a depreciating asset that constantly screams for more of my money (petrol, registration, insurance, servicing etc.). Is making my already convenient life more convenient really worth that kind of money? That’s an additional $3,000 I could put towards an overseas trip, which I plan to go on at least once a year.

### Goodbye Credit Card 💳
The second thing I’ll be saying goodbye to will be my credit card. I initially thought using a credit card would be great for racking up points for rewards, but all it took was 1 missed payment to give everything I patiently accrued back and if not more. I will instead put together a budget and transfer 10% of my income to a second debit account each month to spend and then re-invest the rest.

### Discipline = No more gym? 💪
The third thing I'm sitting on the fence about is whether I want to commit to a gym membership. When I think about it, I’m not actually paying for any equipment since I’ll be doing classes, which means what I'm really paying for is the company of others who are working towards achieving a common goal. All I really need is to have the discipline to exercise at home, and I wouldn’t have to part ways with $60 a month, saving me a total of $720 a year. 

### Can we really give up coffee... ☕️
Last but not least, coffee. I have tried, and I have failed miserably to give up the warm cup of joy that has worked its way to becoming an integral part of life for Melbournians. What is life if we’re too cheap to fork out $5 on something that legitimately brightens up our day, and gives our morning the kickstart it desperately needs? But ouch, that’s a good $1,200 a year spent on my large, strong, soy flat white with 1 sugar alone.

Hmm... I’ll let the last one brew for a little bit longer 🤔.
