### Update
Goodness! where has the time gone? Last week I mentioned that I would "attempt" to read an illustrated book on stock investing & trading, but I never even made it past the cover... I guess me and books are just not meant to be!

All hope is not lost though, I did start making an app to fetch all ASX shares that pay dividends...

**Day 1:**

I'm not exactly sure where I am heading with this, but what I am defs sure about is that there are a bajillion apps out there that are doing the exact same thing! #reinventingthewheel

**Day 2:**

I think I need to put on my designer hat as well, the app is coming along like a stereotypical trading app. Also still need to create a separate call to retrieve a stock's latest trading price and calculate its yield.


**Day 3:**

Squeezed in some time refactoring and finished populating all the fields. Still needs to be organised by date and have a seperate tab listing all the upcoming dividends, the days until the cut off date along with a hundred other things.

Tomorrow is another day. 💁
